# Neural-Network-Image-Style

**AGENDA:**
In this project, you'll be exploring the exciting world of neural style transfer, where you'll harness the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to transform images into works of art!  You'll build a system that can take a regular photo and apply the artistic style of another image, like a famous painting.  We'll delve into the architecture of the CNN, specifically an encoder-decoder structure, to understand how it separates the content (what's in the image) from the style (how it looks).  By training the network with clever loss functions, you'll teach it to preserve the content of your photo while infusing it with the artistic flair of your chosen style image.  Get ready to see your project generate stunning, artistic images! 


**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
Develop a deep learning system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve Neural Style Transfer.
This system should be able to:

Separate content and style: Given two images, a content image and a style image, the system needs to learn to differentiate between the semantic content (objects, shapes) in the content image and the artistic style (brushstrokes, color palettes) in the style image.

Generate stylized images: The system should create a new image (generated image) that preserves the content of the content image while adopting the artistic style of the style image.
